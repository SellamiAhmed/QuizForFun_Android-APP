/home/ahmed/AndroidStudioProjects/mini_projet_android/quiz/AIQuiz/app/lint-baseline.xml: Information: 1 errors/warnings were listed in the baseline file (lint-baseline.xml) but not found in the project; perhaps they have been fixed? Another possible explanation is that lint recently stopped analyzing (and including results from) dependent projects by default. You can turn this back on with android.lintOptions.checkDependencies=true. Unmatched issue types: NewApi [LintBaselineFixed]

   Explanation for issues of type "LintBaselineFixed":
   If a lint baseline describes a problem which is no longer reported, then
   the problem has either been fixed, or perhaps the issue type has been
   disabled. In any case, the entry can be removed from the baseline (such
   that if the issue is reintroduced at some point, lint will complain rather
   than just silently starting to match the old baseline entry again.)

/home/ahmed/AndroidStudioProjects/mini_projet_android/quiz/AIQuiz/app/src/main/res/drawable-v24: Warning: This folder configuration (v24) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 24. Merge all the resources in this folder into drawable. [ObsoleteSdkInt]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.
